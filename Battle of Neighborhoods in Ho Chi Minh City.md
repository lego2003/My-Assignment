# 1. Introduction and Objective
Bulging with a population of nearly seven million, Ho Chi Minh City, is Vietnam's largest and most exciting city. While Hanoi is the center of government, Ho Chi Minh City is the nation's economic heart.

Ho Chi Minh City is the most populous city in Vietnam with a population of 8.4 million. Located in southeastern Vietnam, the metropolis surrounds the Saigon River and covers about 2,061 square kilometres (796 square miles).

My friend wanted to open a restaurant or a cafe in this city, but he didn't know where to open with little competition. This data analysis article will clarify and may help him some useful information for his decision

# 2. Data Sets and APIs
### Ho Chi Minh Neighborhoods Data
List of districts, wards of Ho Chi Minh. I download from the following url: https://www.gso.gov.vn/dmhc2015/Default.aspx
### Google map API
This project would use Google Map API Geocoder to get the Latitude and Longitude of each area.
### Foursquare API
This project would use Four-square API as its prime data gathering source. This API provides the ability to perform location search, location sharing and details about a business.
